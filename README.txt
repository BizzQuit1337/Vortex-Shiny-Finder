This was simply made for fun and will get accounts banned

To start the script simply run it then click on the game window, after 3 seconds the movement should begin
once a shiny pokemon has been encountered it will begin the battle and catch the shiny pokemon by throwing

If you want to look for specific pokemon or another type other than shiny all you need to change are the 
corrisponding variables in the variables area

This was simply made for fun and will get accounts banned

To start the script simply run it then click on the game window, after 3 seconds the movement should begin
once a shiny pokemon has been encountered it will begin the battle and catch the shiny pokemon by throwing 
5 ultra balls at it, this was lazily added in but the number is changeable.

If you want to look for specific pokemon or another type other than shiny all you need to change are the 
corrisponding variables in the variables area

The pokedex.txt file is a store of all the names being read via tesseract saved into a file, this was incase
i wanted a specific pokemon I could copy all the spellings and use a for loop to check for the pokemon 
(pytesseract isnt always perfect at translating names) 

The battledPokemon.txt file tells you which pokemon you have started a battle with. This is for checking 
and deubugging so you can see if the script found a pokemon and didnt catch it while you were away
